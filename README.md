# Student Success Predictors

## Socioeconomic Factors and Academic Success

Socioeconomic factors play a significant role in a student's academic success. Based on our analysis, there appears to be a strong correlation between socioeconomic factors and academic performance.

To visualize this relationship, we suggest using a line plot that compares a student's previous experience with their academic outcome. The line plot is expected to show a positive correlation between students who have prior experience and positive academic results.

This highlights the importance of addressing socioeconomic factors in promoting student success.
